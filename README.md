# Drag and Drop File Plugin


Drag and Drop File is a plugin created to meet the need to add usability to the user, making it easier to start filling out a registration form. This way, the user can drag and drop a file into a Fabrik list and an Add form will automatically open with the file already present in the fileupload element.

  Moment where the file is dragged to the list
</div><br>

<div align="center">
